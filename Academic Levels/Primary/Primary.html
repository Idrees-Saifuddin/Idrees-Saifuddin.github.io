                        <h5>Primary Curriculum </h5>
                        <h5>Our school curriculum is based on four important principles: </h5>
                        <ul>
                          <li>It is broad: It introduces children to a wide range of knowledge, understanding and skills. </li>
                          <li>It is balanced: Each area of learning is valued and allocated sufficient time.</li>
                          <li>It is differentiated: It matches children's individual needs, abilities and aptitudes.</li>
                          <li>It is relevant: It is designed to interest children and relate to their own life experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5> In Grade 1 â€“ 5, learning is organized into core subjects and foundation subjects: </h5>
                        <h5>Core subjects:</h5>
                        <p>1) English (including speaking, listening, reading, writing, spelling and handwriting), Mathematics, Science, Urdu Foundation subjects.</p>
                        <p>2) Social Studies, Islamiat & Nazra and Art.</p>
                        <h5>English</h5>
                        <p>English has a high priority on our timetable with more time given to it than any other subject and standards in all areas of English are high. We work hard to ensure all children develop excellent literacy skills as they are the key to children succeeding in so many other areas of the curriculum. All children are taught English every day and experience a wealth of speaking and listening activities and opportunities for reading and writing to develop their communication skills. There is a wide-ranging English curriculum ensuring children gain understanding of high-quality fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, classic and modern and screen based texts. Children write for real audiences and purpose to inspire their writing.</p>
                        <p>Phonics is an important and enjoyable part of our English teaching and standards in reading are particularly high. Time is set aside each day specifically to teach reading and all children read with their teacher at least weekly. All teachers regularly read aloud to their classes to encourage them to enjoy a greater range of texts and develop their enjoyment of reading. Besides these, Listening Exercises are also introduced through Multimedia.</p>

Mental maths and problem solving are an important part of every lesson. Learning through a clear progression of mental and written methods, children develop understanding and the skills to carry out calculations independently.</p>
                        <h5>Science</h5>
                        <p>Standards in science are very high and children develop excellent investigative skills from an early age. Children are encouraged to ask questions and to extend their understanding of scientific concepts.</p>
                        <h5>Examination</h5>
